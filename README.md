# Digit-Classification
Digit classification project following Nielsen's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository contains my implementations of two neural networks meant to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
This was meant as a learning project, so I challenged myself to complete the task without using any machine-learning-specific libraries.

digits.py trains a fully-connected network with several layers of sigmoid neurons. 
digits2.py exapands this to a network that can include convolutional and softmax layers.
